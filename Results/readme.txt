Summary and outlook

We have demonstrated that temporal fluctuations can impede evolutionary branching compared to a stable environment, such that branching occurs only with broader resource distributions (reflected in a greater ). This effect arises only if the position of the carrying capacity curve, K(x), changes from year to year. The effect of fluctuations is stronger if the distribution of the peak of K(x) is overdispersed (assuming the same range, two extreme values of t give the strongest effect, with decreasing effects for a uniform distribution and a truncated Gaussian distribution), and if r is large (in which case the resident density is strongly fluctuating).

A weakness of the present model is that the Lotka-Volterra equations (eqs. 1,2) may predict negative growth rates and hence negative population sizes. To avoid this biologically nonsense result, the model can be truncated such that growth rate is zero whenever the original equations would yield a negative value; in this case, the model allows for abrupt extinction. It would be of biological relevance to repeat the present work using alternative models of population growth (such as the Beverton-Holt or Ricker equations) that are invariant on the positive numbers.

There are many models known that predict evolutionary branching (see http://users.utu.fi/evakis/addyn.htm for a collection of references): Speciation-prone ecological situations appear to be common. Now it is of interest to uncover ecological factors that hinder evolutionary branching and may prevent speciation in more realistic ecological models. One such possibility is if ecological interactions occur only locally, between a few neighbours (Day 2001; Mágori and Meszéna, in prep.). Spatial structure may impede diversification also if large, well-mixed populations are involved. Day (2000) extended the stable-environment Lotka-Volterra model discussed above for two populations connected by migration, assuming that the peak of K(x) is at different trait values in the two populations. He found that this spatial structure impedes evolutionary branching if migration is common, but promotes branching if migration is rare. In our model with temporal fluctuations, the changing location of the peak made evolutionary branching invariably more difficult.
